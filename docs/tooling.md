# Tooling

## Introduction

Pikoshi requires certain formatters, linters, and other coding tools in order to
maintain a consistent style across the project. Thusly it is required that you
utilize the following tools within your editor:

### VSCode Tools:

- [Python Black](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.black-formatter)
- [Isort](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.isort)
- [Pydantic/Pylance](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/integrations/visual_studio_code/)
- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

Please note that if you use any other editor to please contact the Project
Maintainer and they can give you instructions on how to set up a proper tooling
environment in your editor of choice.

Also note that eventually the Pikoshi Project will use various Git Hooks and
CI/CD pipeline strategies to ensure compliance with code consistency standards.
