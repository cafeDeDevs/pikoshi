# Pikoshi (Frontend)

Pikoshi: The Photo Sharing Application With Privacy In Mind By Default üê±

## Introduction

This directory contains the frontend for the application, Pikoshi.

**PreRequisite Dependencies:**

To use this as a basic template for future projects, you'll first need to have
[bun](https://bun.sh/) installed.

**Getting Started:**

Once you have the prerequisite dependencies installed, you can simply use the
bun package manager to install the dependencies.

```sh
bun install
```

Once installed, you can start up the `dev` server by running:

```sh
bun dev
```

**Testing:**

While `bun` does have it's own test runner, it is currently incompatible with
[vitest](https://vitest.dev/), so please use the custom `test` script instead:

```sh
# NOT THIS:
bun test
# DO THIS INSTEAD:
bun run test
```
